My method follows.
Ingredients:
good, ripe organic pumpkin sugar ground ginger ground cinnamon ground nutmeg ground cloves The spices are added step-by-step their ratios explained. Spice qualities are different by brand, also by country, any fixed recipe is misdirection.
Preparation:
Cut the pumpkin to big chunks, put it to the oven for a good 40-45 minutes until you see strong marks of caramelized sugars.</description></item></channel></rss>
