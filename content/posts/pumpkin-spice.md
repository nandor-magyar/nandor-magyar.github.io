I've been making pumpkin spice pure for years now, with decent result. My method follows.

Ingredients:
- good, ripe organic pumpkin
- sugar
- ground ginger
- ground cinnamon
- ground nutmeg
- ground cloves

The spices are added step-by-step their ratios explained.
Spice qualities are different by brand, also by country, any fixed recipe is misdirection.


Preparation:
1. Cut the pumpkin to big chunks, put it to the oven for a good 40-45 minutes until you see strong marks of caramelized sugars.
2. Let it rest.
3. Put 5-7 tbsp sugar to the stove & start caramellization, don't wait until completion add 300-400ml water halfway.
4. Wait until the caramel dissolves, while keeping the gas on a low setting.
5. Peel the baked pumpkin add it to the sugar-caramel syrup.
6. Add the ginger powder 2-4 teaspoon (full), if the ginger powder is hot and feels spicy use less.
7. Add the same amount of cinnamon.
8. Add half amount or slightly less than half of ground nutmeg, if it is strong use a bit less.
9. Add half or slightly less ground cloves.
10. Use some blending device to make a smooth paste.
11. After blending, adjust the flavor if needed, sometimes I find extra ginger helps.

Be careful, too much cloves can spoil the blend easily, be careful with that one, other spices are less dominant even overdone.

Serving: 1 tablespoon of purÃ©e to 2dl of milk with an espresso shot.
